# Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, I work to classify the sentiment of tweets to be either positive or negative. The dataset used is the Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle, which is made up of 1.6 million tweets from Twitter that have been denoted either 0 (negative), 2 (neutral), and 4 (positive). The dataset can be found under the dataset tag.
