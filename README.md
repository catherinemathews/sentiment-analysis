# Sentiment-Analysis
As of May 2022, every second, on average, roughly 10,033 tweets are sent on Twitter. In the bigger picture, this amounts to over 867 millions tweet sent per day. In this project, I work to classify the sentiment of such tweets to be either positive or negative. The dataset used is the Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle, which is made up of 1.6 million tweets from Twitter that have been denoted either 0 (negative), 2 (neutral), and 4 (positive). The dataset can be found under the dataset tag.
